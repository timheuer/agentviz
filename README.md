# ◇ AGENTVIZ

**See what your AI agents actually do.**

Drop a Claude Code or Copilot CLI session file and explore the agent's reasoning, tool calls, and output through an interactive timeline. Or run it from the CLI for a live view that updates as your session unfolds.

## Why AGENTVIZ?

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, etc.) generate dense session logs, but reading raw JSONL is painful. AGENTVIZ turns those logs into something you can actually explore:

- **Replay** sessions like a video, stepping through each tool call and reasoning step
- **Visualize** timing and concurrency in a DAW-style multi-track timeline
- **Analyze** tool usage patterns, error rates, and model behavior at a glance
- **Debug** failures by jumping directly between errors with one keystroke
- **Stream live** as a session unfolds -- the view updates in real time

## Quick Start

### Web app (drag and drop)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayparikh/agentviz.git
cd agentviz
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Drop a `.jsonl` session file or click **load a demo session** to try it instantly.

### CLI (live streaming)

```bash
# Point at a specific session file
node bin/agentviz.js ~/.claude/projects/my-project/session.jsonl

# Or pass a directory -- opens the most recently modified .jsonl inside it
node bin/agentviz.js ~/.claude/projects/my-project/
```

The browser opens with a pulsing **LIVE** badge. As Claude Code writes new events to the session file, they stream into the view in real time via SSE, including records that are written incrementally before the trailing newline lands.

### Finding your session files

```bash
# Claude Code sessions
ls ~/.claude/projects/

# Copilot CLI sessions
ls ~/.copilot/session-state/
# Each subdirectory is a session UUID containing an events.jsonl file
```

## MCP Integration

AGENTVIZ ships as an MCP server so you can open it directly from Claude Code or GitHub Copilot in VS Code without leaving your workflow. Both agents use the same `launch_agentviz` and `close_agentviz` tools.

### Claude Code

**Setup (one time):**

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user agentviz node /path/to/agentviz/mcp/server.js
```

This registers the server globally across all projects. Restart Claude Code to pick it up.

**Usage:** In any session, just ask:

> "Open agentviz" or "Show me the live view"

### GitHub Copilot in VS Code

**Setup:** Add the server to your VS Code user settings (`settings.json`) for global access across all projects:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "agentviz": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["/path/to/agentviz/mcp/server.js"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or scope it to a single project by creating `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "agentviz": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/agentviz/mcp/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Reload VS Code after adding the config. In Copilot Chat, use **Agent mode** and ask:

> "Open agentviz" or "Launch the live view"

### What happens when you invoke it

`launch_agentviz` will:
1. Auto-detect the most recently active session file (checks `~/.claude/projects/` and `~/.copilot/session-state/`)
2. Start a local HTTP server on a free port
3. Open the browser with live streaming enabled

To stop it, ask: "Close agentviz"

### Available MCP tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `launch_agentviz` | Start the server and open the browser. Accepts an optional `session_file` path. |
| `close_agentviz` | Stop a running server. Accepts an optional `port`; omit to stop all. |

## Session Comparison

Load two agent traces side by side to compare them head to head. Great for benchmarking Claude Code vs Copilot CLI on the same task, or comparing two different prompting strategies.

### Entry points

- **Landing screen** -- click "compare two sessions" below the drop zone
- **Single-session header** -- click **Compare** while viewing any session to add a second trace for comparison
- **Compare landing** -- drop Session A and Session B independently; the view opens once both are loaded

### Scorecard tab

Side-by-side metrics with delta badges:

| Metric | Delta color |
|--------|-------------|
| Duration | Green = A faster |
| Cost / PRUs | Green = A cheaper (delta suppressed for cross-agent comparisons since units differ) |
| Input / Output tokens | Neutral |
| Cache reads / writes | Neutral (shown only when cache data present) |
| Premium requests (PRU) | Green = A uses fewer (shown only for Copilot sessions) |
| Tool calls | Neutral |
| Errors | Green = A has fewer |
| Turns | Neutral |
| Files touched | Neutral |

### Tools tab

Horizontal bar chart showing tool call counts for both sessions on the same axis. Blue bars = Session A, purple bars = Session B.

### Export

Click **Export** in any header to download a single self-contained `.html` file. Share it with anyone -- no server required. Opening it reproduces the full session or comparison view exactly as you see it.

Export is available in two places:
- **Single session header** -- exports the current session
- **Comparison header** -- exports both sessions and the full comparison view

> Export requires the production build (`npm run build`). It is not available in the Vite dev server.

## Features

### Replay View

Chronological event stream with a resizable inspector sidebar. Click any event to see full details plus a payload inspector with readable JSON or text, top-level keys, line and character counts, copy support, and expand or collapse controls. The colorful timeline bar at top shows event density and error locations.

</div>

### Tracks View

DAW-style multi-track lanes for Reasoning, Tool Calls, Context, and Output. Solo (**S**) isolates one track. Mute (**M**) hides it. See at a glance how your agent's time was spent.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/screenshots/tracks-view.png" alt="Tracks View" width="800" />
</div>

### Waterfall View

Gantt-style timeline of every tool call, sorted by start time with nesting for overlapping calls. Hover any bar to see duration and timing. Click to open the full inspector, including inline diffs for file edits and readable input or result payload previews.

<img src="docs/screenshots/waterfall-view.png" alt="Waterfall View" width="800" />
</div>

### Stats View

Aggregate metrics, event distribution bars, tool usage ranking, and a per-turn summary. Includes token counts and estimated USD cost per turn for Claude models.

### Parser API

`parseSession(text)` auto-detects the format and returns a normalized structure:

```js
// Every event has the same shape regardless of source format
{ t, agent, track, text, duration, intensity, toolName?, toolInput?, raw, turnIndex, isError, model?, tokenUsage? }

// Turns group events by conversation round
{ index, startTime, endTime, eventIndices, userMessage, toolCount, hasError }

// Session-level stats
{ totalEvents, totalTurns, totalToolCalls, errorCount, duration, models, primaryModel, tokenUsage }
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev         # Dev server on port 3000
npm run build       # Production build to dist/
npm test            # Run all tests via Vitest
npm run test:watch  # Watch mode
```

### Design System

True black base (`#000000`) with blue, purple, and green accents. Vivid semantic colors: green for success, muted red for warning, bright red for error. All colors are defined as design tokens in `src/lib/theme.js`. JetBrains Mono throughout. No CSS framework; all styles are inline.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some areas where help is appreciated:

- **New parsers**: LangSmith, OpenTelemetry, custom agent frameworks
- **Visualizations**: Conversation flow graph (directed graph of turns and decisions)
