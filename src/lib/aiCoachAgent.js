/**
 * AI Coach Agent
 *
 * Analyzes an AgentViz session using the @github/copilot-sdk -- the same
 * engine that powers Copilot CLI. The agent reads real config files from disk
 * before proposing changes, and commits each recommendation via a structured
 * `recommend` tool call.
 *
 * Auth: Uses the developer's logged-in Copilot credentials automatically.
 * No additional setup needed -- reuses the same session the developer uses.
 *
 * Agent loop:
 *   1. Spawn Copilot CLI in server mode via JSON-RPC (SDK handles lifecycle)
 *   2. Send session stats + system prompt + tool definitions
 *   3. Model calls read_config(path) to inspect real files
 *   4. Model calls recommend(...) for each concrete fix
 *   5. Session idles when done
