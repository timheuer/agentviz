# ◇ AgentViz

**See what your AI agents actually do.**

Drop a Claude Code or Copilot CLI session file and explore the agent's reasoning, tool calls, and output through an interactive timeline.

*Replay an AI coding session event by event, with full tool call inspection.*

## Why AgentViz?

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, etc.) generate dense session logs, but reading raw JSONL is painful. AgentViz turns those logs into something you can actually explore:

- **Replay** sessions like a video, stepping through each tool call and reasoning step
- **Visualize** timing and concurrency in a DAW-style multi-track timeline
- **Analyze** tool usage patterns, error rates, and model behavior at a glance
- **Debug** failures by jumping directly between errors with one keystroke

No backend. No sign-up. Just drag, drop, and explore.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayparikh/agentviz.git
cd agentviz
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Drop a `.jsonl` session file or click **Load Demo Session** to try it instantly.

### Finding your session files

```bash
# Claude Code sessions
ls ~/.claude/projects/

# Copilot CLI event traces (location varies by config)
```

## Features

### Session Overview

After loading a file, a summary card shows key metrics with an activity sparkline. Format and model are auto-detected. Press Space or click **Dive In** to enter the timeline.

</div>

### Replay View

Chronological event stream with a resizable inspector sidebar. Click any event to see full details, raw JSON, and tool inputs. The colorful timeline bar at top shows event density and error locations.

</div>

### Tracks View

DAW-style multi-track lanes for Reasoning, Tool Calls, Context, and Output. Solo (**S**) isolates one track. Mute (**M**) hides it. See at a glance how your agent's time was spent.

</div>

### Stats View

Aggregate metrics, event distribution bars, tool usage ranking, and a per-turn summary. Quickly spot which tools dominate a session and where errors occurred.

### More Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Search** | Full-text search across events, tools, and agents. Matches highlighted in real time. |
| **Command Palette** | `Cmd+K` fuzzy search to jump to any turn, event, or view instantly. |
| **Error Navigation** | Auto-detects errors from flags and text patterns. Jump with `E` / `Shift+E`. |
| **Track Filters** | Toggle visibility per track type with filter chips in the header. |
| **Playback Control** | Play/pause with variable speed (0.5x to 8x). Seek with arrow keys. |
| **Auto-detect Format** | Supports Claude Code and Copilot CLI JSONL. Format detected from first line. |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `Left` / `Right` | Seek 2 seconds |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | Switch view (Replay / Tracks / Stats) |
| `/` | Focus search |
| `E` / `Shift+E` | Next / Previous error |
| `Cmd+K` | Command palette |
| `Enter` / `Shift+Enter` | Next / Previous search match |

## Supported Formats

| Format | File type | Auto-detected by |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `.jsonl` from `~/.claude/projects/` | Default fallback |
| Copilot CLI | `.jsonl` event traces | `session.start` with `producer: "copilot-agent"` |

More formats planned: LangSmith traces, OpenTelemetry spans.

## Architecture

    usePlayback.js       # Play/pause, speed, seek state machine
    useSearch.js         # Debounced full-text search with match highlighting
    useKeyboardShortcuts.js  # Centralized keyboard handler

    Timeline.jsx         # Scrubable playback bar with event markers
```

### Parser API

`parseSession(text)` auto-detects the format and returns a normalized structure:

```js
// Every event has the same shape regardless of source format
{ t, agent, track, text, duration, intensity, toolName?, toolInput?, raw, turnIndex, isError }

// Turns group events by conversation round
{ index, startTime, endTime, eventIndices, userMessage, toolCount, hasError }

// Session-level stats
{ totalEvents, totalTurns, totalToolCalls, errorCount, duration, models, primaryModel }
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev         # Dev server on port 3000
npm run build       # Production build to dist/
npm test            # Run all tests via Vitest
npm run test:watch  # Watch mode
```

### Design System

The design uses a true black base with blue, purple, grey, and teal accents. All colors are defined as design tokens in `src/lib/theme.js`. JetBrains Mono throughout. No CSS framework; all styles are inline.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some areas where help is appreciated:

- **New parsers**: LangSmith, OpenTelemetry, custom agent frameworks
- **Visualizations**: Flame chart view, conversation flow graph, inline diff viewer
- **Features**: Bookmarks/annotations, session comparison, live streaming mode
- **CLI launcher**: `npx agentviz session.jsonl`

Please open an issue to discuss larger changes before submitting a PR.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Token count tracking and cost estimation per turn
- [ ] Tool execution waterfall / flame chart view
- [ ] Inline diff viewer for file-editing tool calls
- [ ] Conversation flow graph (directed graph of turns and decisions)
- [ ] Bookmarks and annotations (persisted to localStorage)
- [ ] Multi-agent hierarchy (parent/child agents, nested tracks)
- [ ] Live streaming mode (tail a session file in real time)
- [ ] CLI launcher: `npx agentviz session.jsonl`
- [ ] Shareable session URLs
- [ ] Vim-style keyboard navigation
